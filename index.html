      <section id="About-Dale">
        <h2>About Dale</h2>
        
        <p> I was raised in the state of Missouri, where I studied horticulture. I expanded my horticulture studies to Austin,TX advancing in landscape design.</p>
        
        <p>As I dived into the tech side of land design. I had a spark that grew for being able to understand and develope code work. As I have ideas to help the industry contractors and also extremely enjoy problem solving. </p>
        
        <p>I am currently a student with the <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a> school program, but I already have skills that I have developed and shaped that excite me to contribute with or grow more in the future.</p>
        
        <p>A few of my developed skills as follows:</p>
        
          <ul>
          <li>Passion for problem solving and never feeling defeated when stuck in situations.</li>
          <li>Ability to listen and understand the needs and wants of  clients and be able to produce a product in relation.</li>
          <li>Being able to play all parts on a team. I am able to enjoy being a team follower and say my input when needed or flip the script and be a team leader and listen to my team. </li>
          </ul>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>My interests run far to gaming, rock climbing, astronmy and horticulture among many other things, but I would like to take these interests and work with those that may need software development help as I will already have an understanding of the product.</p> 
        
        <p>Note that even though your product may not be currently listed, I'd love to learn! So it will be an interest of mine down the road! Please feel free to contact me for any questions or looking to hire a new developer.</p>
